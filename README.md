# MANET-Routing-Compare-in-NS-3


NS3 Manet Simulation

In MANET, the routers are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. Thus, the networkâ€™s wireless topology may change rapidly and unproductively.An ad hoc network is a collection of mobile nodes that dynamically form a temporary network and are capable of communicating with each other without the use of a network infrastructure or any centralized administration.We Provide customized NS3 MANET SIMULATION Projects for Students and Research Scholars based on your requirement and 100% satisfaction.

Features of MANET:

    Energy constraint are of important consideration.
    Security is limited.
    Autonomous and no infrastructure needed.
    Communication is via wireless means.
    Can be setup anywhere.
    Nodes can perform the roles of both hosts and routers.
    Dynamic network topology and also frequent network updates.
    No centralized controller and infrastructure. Intrinsic mutual trust.

Broadcasting approaches in MANET:

    Geocasting.
    Unicasting.
    Broadcasting.
    Multicasting.

Challenges on routing:

    Location-aided routing.
    Routing.
    Achieve QoS.
    Communication within an ad hoc network, inter-networking between MANET and fixed networks.
    Power consumption.
    Security and reliability.
